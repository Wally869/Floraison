Hereâ€™s the general idea for making your stamens feel botanically plausible in your generator:

Relative height:

Stamens usually arise above the base of the petals, attached around the receptacle (the flowerâ€™s center).

Their filaments (the stalks) extend upward so that the anthers (pollen sacs) sit somewhere near or just above the pistilâ€™s base, sometimes even level with the stigma.

Orientation (angle to pistil):

Stamens can be tuned between nearly upright (parallel to pistil) and spread outward (perpendicular or slightly drooping).

Different species have characteristic orientations. For example:

Lilies â†’ stamens spread out horizontally.

Hibiscus â†’ stamens are fused into a tube around the pistil.

Tomato/eggplant â†’ stamens stand nearly parallel and form a tight cone around the pistil.

Radial placement:

Distribute stamens evenly around the pistil in a ring.

Often they are positioned between petals (alternate phyllotaxy), which looks very natural.

So yes:
ðŸ‘‰ Place them above the petal base, let their tilt angle be tunable (0Â° = upright, 90Â° = flat/spreading), and arrange them evenly around the pistil.
