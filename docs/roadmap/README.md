## Epic File Format

Each epic file contains:
- **Header**: Epic number, title, phase, goal, and estimated effort
- **Tasks**: All tasks within that epic with:
  - Task number and title
  - Description
  - Acceptance criteria (checklist format)
  - Dependencies (references to other tasks)
  - Technical notes (code samples, algorithms, implementation details)
  - Effort estimate
- **Completion Checkpoints**: Deliverables and testing procedures (where applicable)

## Navigation

- **Main Overview**: See [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for the high-level roadmap with progress tracking
- **Individual Epics**: Browse the phase directories above for detailed task breakdowns
- **Current Status**: Check the main ROADMAP.md for current progress and next steps

## File Sizes

The epic files range from ~2KB to ~12KB each, making them much more manageable than the original monolithic roadmap file (which was 3,247 lines / ~100KB).
